# Example_tasks

This directory contains examples of programming tasks that are intended to demonstrate various programming techniques, solutions, and concepts. Each task is included in a separate file and contains a description of the problem and solution code.

## **Contents:**
**[Lab00](https://github.com/dawidolko/Programming-C/tree/main/Example_tasks/simple%20tasks):** Environment configuration

**[Lab01](https://github.com/dawidolko/Programming-C/tree/main/Example_tasks/Lab1):** Variables, Operators, Conditional statements, IN/OUT

**[Lab02](https://github.com/dawidolko/Programming-C/tree/main/Example_tasks/lab2):** Loops and arrays

**[Lab03](https://github.com/dawidolko/Programming-C/tree/main/Example_tasks/lab3):** Functions, pointers, variable scope

**[Lab04](https://github.com/dawidolko/Programming-C/tree/main/Example_tasks/lab4):** Standard libraries and string operations

**[Lab05](https://github.com/dawidolko/Programming-C/tree/main/Example_tasks/lab5):** Casting, logical connectives and structures

**[Lab06](https://github.com/dawidolko/Programming-C/tree/main/Example_tasks/lab6):** Tic-Tac-Toe Game

**[Lab07](https://github.com/dawidolko/Programming-C/tree/main/Example_tasks/lab7):** Writing and reading files

**[Lab08](https://github.com/dawidolko/Programming-C/tree/main/Example_tasks/lab8):** Unions and memory allocation

**[Kolokwium](https://github.com/dawidolko/Programming-C/tree/main/Example_tasks/kolokwium2):** Revision of the material

Each task includes a detailed description of the problem, sample input and output, and solution code. You can use these examples as a starting point for solving similar problems or as material to learn and experiment with different programming techniques.

I encourage you to read the individual examples and use them for educational and practical purposes. If you have any questions or comments about these tasks, please feel free to contact me via GitHub.

Good luck and happy programming!
